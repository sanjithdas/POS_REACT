<!-- Vite (pronounced “veet”) is a modern build tool designed to provide a faster and more efficient development experience for web projects. It consists of two main parts:

Development Server: This server offers features like extremely fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR), which allows you to see changes in your code almost instantly without needing to refresh the page.
Build Command: When you’re ready to deploy your app, the vite build command bundles your code using Rollup, producing highly optimized static assets suitable for production12. -->
